👨🏽‍💻 I’m in my final semester of my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Arizona State University. I’ll begin my graduate studies in Spring 2026, pursuing a Master’s in Robotics and Autonomous Systems (AI) at ASU.

🤖🔬 My research interests lie in reinforcement learning and algorithmic optimization, with a focus on applications in robotics.

# Selected Experience

## 👨🏽‍💼 Professional Experience
I interned at Rubitection Inc., where I built data pipelines and developed a PyTorch-based image classification model that achieved over 95% accuracy. I also contributed to a Flask + AWS SageMaker integration for deploying ML models, gaining hands-on experience with cloud-based AI systems and computer vision applications.
