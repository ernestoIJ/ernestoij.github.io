👨🏽‍💻 I am currently pursuing a Master’s in Robotics and Autonomous Systems (AI) at Arizona State University, focusing on High-Performance Computing and AI.

📚 I believe the next breakthrough in AI won't just come from better algorithms, but from more efficient hardware-software integration. I enjoy the challenge of reaching "metal-level" performance by optimizing the underlying kernels in C++ and CUDA to squeeze every bit of throughput out of modern silicon.

# Selected Experience

## 👨🏽‍💼 Professional Experience
**Rubitection Inc.** — *AI/ML Intern* (Sep 2024 – Dec 2024)  
I interned at Rubitection Inc., where I built data pipelines and developed a PyTorch-based image classification model that achieved over 95% accuracy. I also contributed to a Flask + AWS SageMaker integration for deploying ML models, gaining hands-on experience with cloud-based AI systems and computer vision applications.
