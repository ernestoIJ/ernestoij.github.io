### Overview
Developed and deployed a **full-stack web platform** for ASU’s CS/CSE Capstone program to automate the project proposal, student matching, and seminar management processes. The platform replaced manual workflows previously handled through spreadsheets and email, significantly improving efficiency and scalability for faculty and students.

### Technical Highlights
- Collaborated with a **team of 6 students and a faculty mentor** to design and implement the system using **Next.js, MySQL, Docker, Node.js, and TypeScript**.  
- Built **admin dashboards** for proposal review, assignment tracking, and seminar management — cutting faculty’s manual workload by approximately **86%**.  
- **Containerized** the application with Docker and deployed it on **ASU’s infrastructure**, achieving **stable live performance** and smooth testing during real-world use.  
- Contributed to **database design, backend logic, and front-end components**, ensuring scalability and maintainability across multiple Capstone cycles.
